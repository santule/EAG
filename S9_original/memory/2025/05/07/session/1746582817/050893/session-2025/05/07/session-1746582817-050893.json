However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles.

The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29. Some of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the purpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal expenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) benefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\u2019 close relatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these diversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and thereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 8 of 29** ----- ### the above mentioned loans (viz. loans mentioned at serial numbers 3, 6 and 8 in the Table under Para 24), on sample basis, is discussed below. 30.

It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables Ltd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: ***Movement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment*** **Image:** Gensol 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 050860500165 Welray 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 0508605002357 Anmol Jaggi 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasmin Kaur 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DLF Limited ***Movement of funds, after DLF returned the funds to Ms. Jasminder Kaur*** **Image:** Matrix Gas 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002354 Welfare 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002357 Anmol Jaggi 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasminder Kaur 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DFL Limited ### **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 11 of 29** ----- ### 38. Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl. No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd. (Blu-Smart\u201d) from its Bank Account No. 68230000001712 with Bandhan Bank. The source of these funds and transactions need further examination. ***Loan for Rs. 43.69 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 6 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 40.

From the above, it is prima facie observed that funds amounting to Rs. 96.69 Crore (Rs. 46.65 Crore + Rs. 50.04 Crore), as mentioned at para 48 above, were diverted from the listed company and ultimately reached the private promoter related entities of Gensol. Further, it can be seen that Rs. 37.5 Crore out of the loan amount of Rs.171.30 Crore taken by Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd., (a subsidiary of Gensol), from IREDA was ultimately transferred to Anmol Singh Jaggi. This aspect need further examination. 54. From the above analysis of the utilization of funds (loans) received by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, it prima-facie appears that the Company grossly mis- utilized funds and also diverted certain funds to the promoter/promoter-related entities. While the Company was to have spent an amount of Rs. 829.86 Crore (including promoter contribution) for buying EVs, bank statement analysis showed that it had transferred Rs. 775 Crore to Go-Auto against which it has obtained delivery of 4,704 EVs costing Rs. 567.73 Crore. 55. Ajay Agarwal, Managing Director of Go-Auto, in his statement recorded before SEBI on March 24, 2025, deposed that an amount of around Rs. 50 Crore was due from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs to Gensol. 56. In this regard, Gensol has now submitted to SEBI in its communication dated April 05, 2025 that Go-Auto owes the Company an amount of Rs. 21.25 Crore as interest for which it has raised a debit note on the dealer. Interestingly, in the same letter, Gensol has noted that, on a consolidated basis, Gensol has a payable of Rs. 5.37 Crore to Go-Auto. 57. From the examination done by SEBI so far, it can be noted prima-facie that even after transferring Rs. 207.27 Crore (Rs. 775 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) over and above the cost price of the 4,704 EVs that have been delivered to Gensol, the Company still had a payable of about Rs. 50 Crore to Go-Auto, as per the claim of MD of Go-Auto submitted under oath. This shortfall prima facie appears to be diversion of funds by Gensol to connected entities using Go-Auto as a conduit, which needs detailed investigation. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 17 of 29** ----- ***Diversion of funds through a connected entity, Wellray Solar Industries Pvt.

As stated above, Wellray was also one of the recipients of funds out of money borrowed by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, which was routed through Go-Auto.\\\\n[Source: INVG67564.pdf, ID: INVG67564_21]', annotations=None)] isError=False\"}",

From the above, it is prima facie observed that funds amounting to Rs. 96.69 Crore (Rs. 46.65 Crore + Rs. 50.04 Crore), as mentioned at para 48 above, were diverted from the listed company and ultimately reached the private promoter related entities of Gensol. Further, it can be seen that Rs. 37.5 Crore out of the loan amount of Rs.171.30 Crore taken by Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd., (a subsidiary of Gensol), from IREDA was ultimately transferred to Anmol Singh Jaggi. This aspect need further examination. 54. From the above analysis of the utilization of funds (loans) received by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, it prima-facie appears that the Company grossly mis- utilized funds and also diverted certain funds to the promoter/promoter-related entities. While the Company was to have spent an amount of Rs. 829.86 Crore (including promoter contribution) for buying EVs, bank statement analysis showed that it had transferred Rs. 775 Crore to Go-Auto against which it has obtained delivery of 4,704 EVs costing Rs. 567.73 Crore. 55. Ajay Agarwal, Managing Director of Go-Auto, in his statement recorded before SEBI on March 24, 2025, deposed that an amount of around Rs. 50 Crore was due from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs to Gensol. 56. In this regard, Gensol has now submitted to SEBI in its communication dated April 05, 2025 that Go-Auto owes the Company an amount of Rs. 21.25 Crore as interest for which it has raised a debit note on the dealer. Interestingly, in the same letter, Gensol has noted that, on a consolidated basis, Gensol has a payable of Rs. 5.37 Crore to Go-Auto. 57. From the examination done by SEBI so far, it can be noted prima-facie that even after transferring Rs. 207.27 Crore (Rs. 775 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) over and above the cost price of the 4,704 EVs that have been delivered to Gensol, the Company still had a payable of about Rs. 50 Crore to Go-Auto, as per the claim of MD of Go-Auto submitted under oath. This shortfall prima facie appears to be diversion of funds by Gensol to connected entities using Go-Auto as a conduit, which needs detailed investigation. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 17 of 29** ----- ***Diversion of funds through a connected entity, Wellray Solar Industries Pvt.

This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined.

From the above, it is prima facie observed that funds amounting to Rs. 96.69 Crore (Rs. 46.65 Crore + Rs. 50.04 Crore), as mentioned at para 48 above, were diverted from the listed company and ultimately reached the private promoter related entities of Gensol. Further, it can be seen that Rs. 37.5 Crore out of the loan amount of Rs.171.30 Crore taken by Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd., (a subsidiary of Gensol), from IREDA was ultimately transferred to Anmol Singh Jaggi. This aspect need further examination. 54. From the above analysis of the utilization of funds (loans) received by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, it prima-facie appears that the Company grossly mis- utilized funds and also diverted certain funds to the promoter/promoter-related entities. While the Company was to have spent an amount of Rs. 829.86 Crore (including promoter contribution) for buying EVs, bank statement analysis showed that it had transferred Rs. 775 Crore to Go-Auto against which it has obtained delivery of 4,704 EVs costing Rs. 567.73 Crore. 55. Ajay Agarwal, Managing Director of Go-Auto, in his statement recorded before SEBI on March 24, 2025, deposed that an amount of around Rs. 50 Crore was due from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs to Gensol. 56. In this regard, Gensol has now submitted to SEBI in its communication dated April 05, 2025 that Go-Auto owes the Company an amount of Rs. 21.25 Crore as interest for which it has raised a debit note on the dealer. Interestingly, in the same letter, Gensol has noted that, on a consolidated basis, Gensol has a payable of Rs. 5.37 Crore to Go-Auto. 57. From the examination done by SEBI so far, it can be noted prima-facie that even after transferring Rs. 207.27 Crore (Rs. 775 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) over and above the cost price of the 4,704 EVs that have been delivered to Gensol, the Company still had a payable of about Rs. 50 Crore to Go-Auto, as per the claim of MD of Go-Auto submitted under oath. This shortfall prima facie appears to be diversion of funds by Gensol to connected entities using Go-Auto as a conduit, which needs detailed investigation. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 17 of 29** ----- ***Diversion of funds through a connected entity, Wellray Solar Industries Pvt. Ltd.*** ### 58. As stated above, Wellray was also one of the recipients of funds out of money borrowed by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, which was routed through Go-Auto.\\\\n[Source: INVG67564.pdf, ID: INVG67564_21]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='as against the 6,400 EVs for which it had secured funding. This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29. Some of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the purpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal expenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) benefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\u2019 close relatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these diversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and thereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 8 of 29** ----- ### the above mentioned loans (viz. loans mentioned at serial numbers 3, 6 and 8 in the Table under Para 24), on sample basis, is discussed below. 30.

From the examination done by SEBI so far, it can be noted prima-facie that even after transferring Rs. 207.27 Crore (Rs. 775 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) over and above the cost price of the 4,704 EVs that have been delivered to Gensol, the Company still had a payable of about Rs. 50 Crore to Go-Auto, as per the claim of MD of Go-Auto submitted under oath. This shortfall prima facie appears to be diversion of funds by Gensol to connected entities using Go-Auto as a conduit, which needs detailed investigation. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 17 of 29** ----- ***Diversion of funds through a connected entity, Wellray Solar Industries Pvt.

As stated above, Wellray was also one of the recipients of funds out of money borrowed by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, which was routed through Go-Auto.\\n[Source: INVG67564.pdf, ID: INVG67564_21]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='as against the 6,400 EVs for which it had secured funding. This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29. Some of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the purpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal expenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) benefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\u2019 close relatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these diversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and thereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 8 of 29** ----- ### the above mentioned loans (viz. loans mentioned at serial numbers 3, 6 and 8 in the Table under Para 24), on sample basis, is discussed below. 30.
